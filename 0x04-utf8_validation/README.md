# Concepts Needed:
    1. Bitwise Operations in Python:

        Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).

    2. UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:

        Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
        Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.

        The  Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets
    3. Data Representation:

        How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
        Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

    4. List Manipulation in Python:

        Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.

    5. Boolean Logic:
        Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.


Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

    Prototype: def validUTF8(data)
    Return: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return False
    A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long
    The data set can contain multiple characters
    The data will be represented by a list of integers
    Each integer represents 1 byte of data, therefore you only need to handle the 8 least significant bits of each integer
